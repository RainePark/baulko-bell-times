		<h1 class="headingtext">ACCEL GEO and reasons why you should do it</h1>
	</div>
	
	<div style="float: left; width: 75%;">
		<p class="credits">idk if it's too late but have a read because this is not a joke.<br><br>do you like bludge subjects? do you like fun excursions? well then accel geo is the subject for you</p>
		<p class="credits"><strong>tl;dr</strong><br>relatively chill subject, really chill teacher, mildly interesting content, lots of bludge periods, and great experience of the hsc</p>
		<p class="credits"><strong>why should you do accel geo?</strong><br>y7 and 8 geo sucks i know but you need to trust me - y11 and 12 geo is so much more chill.<br>obviously there will be exams and whatever but it's a lot more chill than you think.<br>everyone just hangs out, watches videos, plays games and does work like once a week. its basically just 6 free periods a week im not even joking.<br><br>the teacher - mr filewood is the most chill teacher out there and literally does not care what you do. accel geo will literally become the highlight of your weeks.<br><br>the excursions - you get to go on the most random excursions ever because mr filewood loves to take you on "educational" excursions. the best one is probably the northern beaches excursion where you get to go to many different beaches with your friends and just have a great time while actually having fun learning stuff.<br><br>the experience - you gain lots of experience into how hsc works in a fun and more relaxed environment and is the perfect taster for y11 and 12. the content is pretty interesting (if you like stuff about how the world works) and mr filewood teaches through many videos which, despite what you might think, actually gives you a good understanding of the content.</p>
		<p class="credits"><strong>who is this not for?</strong><br>extremely lazy people - keep in mind that it is still a year 11/12 course so there will still be some work and studying that you need to do. (i.e. 1 test per term, usually with essays, and a research project (sgp) that is kind of long but you get like 6 months to do it)<br><br>if you really really extremely hate geography - in the end, the content is still geography, so if you really hate it tht much this probably isn't for you. some of the content that is covered includes: ecosystems around the world and in the great barrier reef and sydney beaches (admittedly somewhat boring but still interesting if you like learning about the world), urban places - learn about big cities around the world and how they work (very interesting topic, very fun), sand dunes and beaches (kinda interesting), and tourism (also mid). overall, if you like learning about the world and random stuff then its actually kinda interesting as long as you do it with your friends.</p>
		<p class="credits"><strong>why am i writing this?</strong><br>many people think that geo is the worst and stuff because y7 and 8 geo is so trash, and so no one picks it at subject selections which means the course can't run. i don't want the subject to go away just because of a bad rep, and i believe that filewood deserves better than this cause its honesly a pretty fun class. this year there isn't even a year 12 geo class because no one picked it.</p>
		<p class="credits"><strong>testimonials (these are real on mums)</strong><br>"every eco test i wonder why i didnt pick accel geo" - Current accel eco student<br>"Accel geo was the best thing that happened to me in year 9 and 10" - Me (Former accel geo student)<br>"I love Michael filewood he is the best teacher. He teaches so well. I've learnt more from him than anyone else" - Current accel geo student<br>"choose accel geo you'll love the excursions - trust me" - Former accel geo student<br>"filewood is a legend" - Former accel geo student<br>"it's lifechanging" - Former accel geo student (Ranked 1 in class)<br>"the 2 years were the most memorable and phenominal experience" - Former accel geo student<br>"i used to used to spend days studying for tests but now i've learnt the skills to speedrun studying" - Former accel geo student</p>
		<p class="credits"><strong>summary</strong><br>honestly, if you have no idea what you want to do and you have a spare unit and you just want to have a good time, get together with your friends and just give accel geo a try cause it was a really fun and valuable experience for me, and you get 2 units for the hsc. the workload is pretty chill and i mean, who doesnt love bludge periods.</p>
